         share your darkest secret,don"t take it to the grave!
         Research shows that by sharing your secrets, you will free up mental capacity while building stronger social bonds
         secrets are everywhere it may be a dark family secret, memories of past traumas â€“ or it may be a shameful memory from childhood that is of great importance but has never before been told. It might even be secrets from work,
         or college,all these secrets may potentially become burdens to carry around on our own.
         Sensemaking happens when we reframe our experiences and assimilate them into our world views. Thus, when we share a secret and get other people's perspectives, we gain new knowledge about the meaning of the situation. 
         This can create a sense of control over the situation and consequently our lives (Pennebaker, 1990).
